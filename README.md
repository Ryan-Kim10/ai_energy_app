AI energy app
- Affordable and Clean Energy
As AI demand grows, our goal is to encourage artificial intelligence data centers to use affordable and clean energy.

- Responsible Consumption and Production
Current AI data centers use between 0.24-0.34 watt-hours and with the current rate of growth, consumption by data centers will soar. This will lead to irresponsible consumption by these data centers. Our app will bring visibility and highlight usage by AI data centers across the country.

- Climate Action
Our app will provide opportunities to give feedback to various legislative bodies so that they can take action and bring the energy consumption by AI data centers under control in order to protect our climate. This is not to discourage the growth of AI but to encourage efficient growth and use while being climate aware.

Our app will highlight events and conferences that discuss energy usage by various AI data centers. We will also encourage and award the most efficient data centers and AI organizations.

Dashboard:
- Nationwide map with landmark (different AI data center icons). when clicked on this presents the statistic connected to that center.
